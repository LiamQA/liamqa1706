            <h3>Parliment Reviews the EDA Act of 2020</h3>
            <img src="https://www.visitrwanda.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/2063/A330-Rwandair-MSN1741-take-off-006-1920x1276.jpg" alt="Immigration">

                Eighteen nations have now joined the Economic and Diplomacy Alliance Act of 2020 following its highly successful passage.
                and obtained all of the advantages specified by the Act. Nonetheless, as a result of the Act's Visa-free advantages, Lingston has obtained 
                almost 600,000 newcomers Since the Act's passage, the number of migrants has expanded dramatically, driving up rent prices and driving up demand for housing and employment.
                Prime Minister Ballestors has called on parliament to reform the EDA Act in order to address this problem. He has also mandated that the Ministry of the Interior select visa applicants more carefully, with a yearly maximum of 3,000.

            <p>
                Five days following the repeal of the Civil Order statute, the National Justice Tribunal issued a warrant for the arrest of 
                four members of parliament on charges of treason against the country and disruption of civil order. The Tribunal chose to keep 
                their identities confidential for the time being and did not reveal who they were.

            <h3>The NSC (National Supreme Council) votes to evokes Article 8, The Civil Order law </h3>
            <img src="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/bjQPcbAG6IJua9Yu_oNsILVR9CU=/960x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PC76HMXLS5JYZF2OLJ3UY4N7RE.jpg" alt="Lingston Riots">
            <p>
                Because of recent violent riots and public unrest, the NSC resolved to activate the public Order statute and impose a countrywide state of emergency. 
                Following the passage of the bill, the Old Guard and the National Defence Force were dispatched to the capital city and evacuated the Aguda family, 
                as well as members of the Parliament and the Supreme Council. Riots erupt as Bill 12-23 passes the voting procedure in Parliament and awaits approval from the Supreme Council. 
                Approving the Bill will grant the extension of certain Parliment members terms to 4 more years. This Bill
                has sparked outrage from the general public including a condemnation from the NSC in an X post, which HSC. Quentin states in 
                the following, "The Supreme Council of Lingston vehmently condemns Parliment's recent decision to pass a bill granting select 
                members a 4-year term extension. This action flagrantly goes against the principles of our constitution, undermining the 
                democratic process."
